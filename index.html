                    So why am I qualified? Most importantly, I’m passionate about creating and improving the things I’m involved in. I’m a
                    quick language learner, whether it be a new Javascript library or Chinese (I’m fluent!). As part of my major, I’ve taken
                    classes in Front-end Web Development, Behavioral Economics, Python, Java and much more – I’m documenting my journey of
                    learning D3 <a href="https://www.notion.so/kaielwooddieu/Kai-Elwood-Dieu-s-Coding-Life-Documentation-e50a3862e1744aeb84fa85c556e507e5">here</a>.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    From an experience standpoint, this summer I interned as the Digital Officer for Drew’s Honeybees, where I managed a
                    team responsible for overhauling the company’s web footprint. I’m currently a freelance web developer, where I’ve
                    developed sites using JS, Bootstrap 4, JQuery, and other languages. My most recent project is <a href="https://www.beverlyhillsinvesting.com/">here</a>. Beyond coding, I
                    have previous intern experience at the US Embassy in Beijing, where I developed economic analysis reports on various
                    parts of the Chinese economy, and with Senator Cardin’s office as part of the US Senate Small Business Committee, where
                    I conducted research and analysis on small business policy implementation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a diverse skillset, I am driven and passionate about what I do, and if accepted to this internship I would
                    approach challenges meticulously and passionately. Thank you so much for your time in reading this letter.

                    Dear Washington Post Graphics Team,
                </h2>
                <p class="page1">
                    Hi! I'm Kai Elwood-Dieu. The Washington Post has been part of my life for as long as I can remember: its sections are
                    the bookends to different chapters of my life – my childhood infatuation with the comic section, my middle school
                    obsessive checking of baseball stats in the sports section, my gradual shift to the front page in high school and
                    beyond.
                </p>
                <p class="page1">
                    As I’ve learned about applications of computer science through my studies of Interactive Media and Business and Computer
                    Science at NYU Shanghai, my interest in storytelling, information design and technology has brought me back to the
                    Washington Post in an entirely new way.
                </p>
                <p class="page1">
                    I’m applying to this internship because I see journalism as an essential part of our democracy, I want to work on a team
                    that conveys information and tells stories with technology, and I think that my experience with CSS, HTML, JavaScript,
                    JQuery, P5.js, AJAX and JSON would be helpful to the graphics development team and an excellent starting off point for
                    learning other essential data visualization languages like D3 (which I’m currently in the process of learning) and
                    contributing to the Washington Post full-time in the future.

                    He was also an active member of group discussions and offered his fellow classmates constructive and positive feedback.
                    I was impressed with his ability to teach himself technologies not used in the classroom, but even more so that he was
                    motivated to learn them. He is a kind collaborator and will flourish when working with and learning from other
                    professionals.

                <p>
                    Due to my work with the New York Times, I understand the unique set of talents that is required for an engineer to work
                    within a news organization. I am certain that Kai’s enthusiasm for learning, considered thought process, and talent for
                    writing code would be an asset to your team. Most importantly, I know Kai would soak up everything he could from the
                    experience of working with you and will undoubtedly flourish in his future career because of it. Because of this, I
                    encourage you to pursue him as a candidate.
